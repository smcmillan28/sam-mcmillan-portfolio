## General Info
This portfolio is designed to operate across multiple different device types (mobile/desktop/tablet).  Using Bootstrap's CSS library along with standard semantic HTML, I was able to style and structure the site using the Bootstrap grid system.  

On each page, you will find a breakdown of columns and rows containing the contents of the page.  

To navigate the site, simply click the desired page on the Navbar in the upper right hand side of the screen!

## Project Takeaways
Among the takeaways and things learned from this project, this portfolio was the first webpage I built that included more than one page of HTML.  Using Bootstrap for the first time, I was able to get a taste of its capabilities when it comes to dynamic styling, page structure, and mobile responsiveness.  The row/column formatting is intuitive and allows the developer to cleanly organize each section of the page.  

I used one media query as a way to keep formatting/spacing and margins for medium and large sized screens.  When viewing on smaller devices like cellphones, you will see margins eliminated along with a streamlined page structure.  See below:

This assignment stretched my abilities regarding web design.  I can't wait to add some real projects to the portfolio section!
