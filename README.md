# Sam McMillan's Web Development Portfolio  
Welcome to my first mobile responsive, web development portfolio!  

Here, I will walk you through the different functions and pages of the website.  Although there isn't much to see yet, I can assure you more exciting things are to come!

## Table of Contents

[About Me](#about-me)

[Contact](#contact)

[Project Takeaways](#project-takeaways)

## General Info
This portfolio is designed to operate across multiple different device types (mobile/desktop/tablet).  Using Bootstrap's CSS library along with standard semantic HTML, I was able to style and structure the site using the Bootstrap grid system.  

On each page, you will find a breakdown of columns and rows containing the contents of the page.  

To navigate the site, simply click the desired page on the Navbar in the upper right hand side of the screen!

## Portfolio
This page is most definitely a work in process.  Come back in a few months, and there will be much more to share with you!

I plan to post my different projects on this page.  We are currently working on becoming Jedis of JavaScript.  Should be a lot of fun things happening here in the future.
