## General Info
This portfolio is designed to operate across multiple different device types (mobile/desktop/tablet).  Using Bulma's CSS library along with standard semantic HTML, I was able to style and structure the site so that no matter where you're browsing, you'll be able to view my page.


There are multiple links throughout the site, whether it be to my resume, app repos, or the apps themselves, so feel free to click around!  The Page Demo below shows the basic navigation of the page.

## Project Takeaways
Among the many takeaways and things learned from this project, being able to add tangible applications to my portfolio section was very rewarding.  Using Bulma, I was able to get a taste of its capabilities when it comes to dynamic styling, page structure, and mobile responsiveness.  

I look forward to diving further into the back-end for future projects so that I can continue adding to my portfolio!
